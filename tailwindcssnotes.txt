Tailwind Css stuff....

** prior knowledge needed :-
	html and css 

I. Setup
	1. install node.js 
		- node -v /checks version and if installed/
	2. open a text editor and open a terminal 
	3. create a new package.json
		- npm init -y /creates package.json which keeps track of the dependencies/
	4. install tailwindcss
		- npm install tailwindcss /it will appear as a dependency, creates node_modules and a package-lock.json/
	5. create a style-source folder inside root directory of the project and create the source css file
		- base, components, utilities append to the css file
	6. create a new script on the package.json file
		- "a_name": "tailwindcss build style-source-directory.css -o new-output-directory.css"
 	7. run the script 
		- npm run a_name
		** run this script every time you change/edit the sourcefile / WE MAY NEED TO USE IT MORE OFTEN THAN EXPECTED - issue??! /

	8. create a tailwind.config.js file; this is a file of different css properties and used by tailwind
		- npx tailwindcss init -full
	9. we can name the former file on no. 8 as tailwind-default.config.js
	10. we can create a new tailwind.config.js file /but an empty one - to be used for custom styles by us/
		- npx tailwindcss init
		

*** ON THE tailwind.config.js files ... add the directory to our template files on the content property inside the file

*optional*--- install the tailwind extension for vscode or other editors so as to make the classes pop when in development
*optional*--- install the liver-server feature.. on terminal:- npm live-server
		----to start it.. on terminal:- live-server the_holding_folder_of_the_html_file
*optional*--- to customize some classes to your liking; go to the tailwind.config.js file and edit the properties there but don't forget to run the css building script when you're done.



II. Working with tailwind
	
** start with creating your html template file
** since tailwind is 
** Go to tailwind docs to view the different properties and styles that tailwind has to offer. 	
	
	1. Font and Color
		- text-'color'-'strength(100-900)' -- the class for text color
		- font-'size/type/bold/semi-bold/etc..' -- the class for the font size, strength, type and so on
		- italic -- class for italic styles
		

	2. Spacing, Padding and Margin
		- p-'number' -- the class for padding all around
		- pt-'number'/pb-'number'/pr-'number'/pl-'number' -- the class for particular side of padding
		- px-'number'/py-'number' -- the class for a padding along a particular axis
			
		- m-'number' -- the class for margin all around
		- mt-'number'/mb-'number'/mr-'number'/ml-'number' -- the class for particular side of margin
		- mx-'number'/my-'number' -- the class for a margin along a particular axis

		- space-'x/y-number' -- it's like adding margin between elements
		- space-'x/y'-reverse -- when reversing the children

			**  1px = 1rem
			** 'number'/ 4 = in_rem
			**  1 = 4px = 0.25rem
	--- the conversion rates above apply for most tailwind properties
		
		N.B. There are other classes for padding, margin and so on.. we can dive deeper into the tailwind documentation for more classes


    3. Borders
		- border-'t/b/r/l-number' border-'color' -- to give the border a width and a color
		- border-'x/y-number' << -- this is in a particular axis
		
		- divide-'x/y-number' << -- this is going to divide the elements with a single border between them
		- divide-'x/y'-reverse  -- this is when reversing the elements
		
	
	4. Background
		- bg-'color-number' -- almost like setting the text color
		- bg-'color-number/opacity'  -- also setting the transparency


	5. Using Flexbox
		- flex -- a class that makes child elements flex items
		- items-'end/start/center.../' -- a class that aligns elements/items
		- justify-'center/end//start...' -- a class that justifies elements
		

	6. Responsive classes
		* in tailwind we don't have to create media queries, instead prefix elements/classes with responsive classes 

		- 'breakpoint_name':'particular_class' -- this is the form of the responsive class
		- example:- "bg-red-500 sm:bg-green-900"  ---  on a breakpoint called 'sm' apply the green class
			
			* we configure the breakpoints at the tailwind.config.js file
